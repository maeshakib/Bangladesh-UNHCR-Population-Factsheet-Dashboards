# Bangladesh-UNHCR-Population-Factsheet-Dashboards

As an Information Management (IM) professional, I support the monthly preparation of the **Bangladesh-UNHCR-Population-Factsheet-Dashboards** â€“ a crucial set of 8 public operational documents, totaling 12 pages, uploaded monthly to the UNHCR [Operational Data Portal](https://data.unhcr.org/en/documents/) under 'Dashboards & Factsheets.' Through this work, I have gained extensive experience in data visualization and dashboard creation. These products effectively present key population statistics and demographic insights for the Joint Government of Bangladesh and UNHCR initiatives. Highly utilized by all UN, INGO, and NGO operations, these dashboards are instrumental in humanitarian efforts and decision-making, providing vital representations of refugee population data specifically for camps in Cox's Bazar and Bhasan Char.

#### Contents

The repository includes dashboards, factsheets, and maps derived from the following publicly available UNHCR documents:
